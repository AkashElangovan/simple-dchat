# Simple Chat App with Gun.js

## Overview

This is a very basic chat application built with [Gun.js](https://gun.eco/), a decentralized real-time database. The app allows users to join a chat room and exchange messages in a decentralized and peer-to-peer manner.

## Features

- **Decentralized Database**: Uses Gun.js to create a decentralized and peer-to-peer data synchronization network.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Enables real-time communication and synchronization of chat messages among users.
- **Simple Interface**: A minimalistic and easy-to-use chat interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Gun.js**: A decentralized and real-time graph database that facilitates data synchronization in a peer-to-peer network.
# Gun.js Overview

## Introduction

Gun.js is a JavaScript library that simplifies real-time, decentralized data synchronization and storage for web applications. It provides an easy-to-use API for handling data relationships and updates in a distributed environment.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Graph Database

Gun.js treats data as a graph, where nodes represent pieces of information and edges define relationships between them. This flexible structure enables easy modeling of complex data.

### 2. Decentralized Architecture

Gun.js allows data to be stored and synchronized across devices without relying on a central server. This decentralized approach enhances scalability and resilience.

## Simple Usage

### 1. Installation

Include Gun.js in your project:
